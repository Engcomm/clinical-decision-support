treatment.
An 8-year-old boy fell from his bike striking his left temple on the pavement. There was no immediate loss of consciousness, and a brief examination at the scene noted his pupils were symmetrical, reactive to the light, and he was moving all four limbs. Half an hour after the fall the child became drowsy, pale, and vomited. He was transferred to the emergency department. Upon arrival the heart rate was 52/min, blood pressure of 155/98. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6/15, the pupils were asymmetrical and movement of the right upper and lower extremities was impaired. The neurosurgical team advised deferring the CT scan in favor of initiating immediate treatment.
