A physician is called to see a 67-year-old woman who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right femoral artery earlier in the morning. She is now complaining of a cool right foot. Upon examination she has a pulsatile mass in her right groin with loss of distal pulses, and auscultation reveals a bruit over the point at which the right femoral artery was entered.
