A 28 yo female G1P0A0 is admitted to the Ob/Gyn service for non-ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Past medical history is remarkable for obesity, a non-complicated appendectomy at age 8, infertility treatment for the past 3 years, and pelvic laparoscopy during which minor right Fallopian tube adhesions were cauterized. Her LMP was 8 weeks prior to admission. Beta HCG is 100 mIU. The attending physician usually treats unruptured ecoptic pregnancies laparoscopically but is concerned about the patient's obesity and history of adhesions.
